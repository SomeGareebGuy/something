# Something
Trying something out.

The basic gist is making a web app for improving the room swap process. An user inputs the room they want and the room they are willing to give out. The account will get a whatsapp notification on the number provided so that when anyone shows an interest in the offer they had given. 

So basically, when posting you have to fill the options for the one you currently have
  - Hall of Residence
  - Room number
  - A toggle for single or double

and for the one you want
  - Floor number
  - Hall of Residence
  - Toggle for single or double
  - Some additional description you want to add

When you register you have to give your whatsapp number so that you recieve a message when anyone shows interest in your post. On the other side when you show interst in a post the author of that post recieves a message with your phone number in it. And when you click the interested button you also get to add some additional description consisting your current room number.
